# ARRuler
Augmented Reality ruler showing distance between 2 points in space.

NOTE: Requires A9 chip or more (iPhone 5 SE, iPhone 6S and above)

How it works:
- touch screen once -> set first dot
- touch screen again -> set second dot and see distance between dots on screen
- touch screen again to reset
